# RallyLife Summarized Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## 1. Introduction

This document provides a high-level overview of the RallyLife gamified tennis system, encompassing both player and coach experiences. It outlines the core functionalities, gamification mechanics, and the integrated ecosystem designed to enhance engagement and skill development.

## 2. Player Gamification System

• **Health Points (HP)**: Tracks player vitality, decays with inactivity, restored by logging activities (matches, training, lessons) or using health packs. Displayed prominently.

• **Experience Points (XP) & Leveling**: Earned through various activities (matches, training, lessons, social engagement, achievements). Progressively more XP needed for higher levels. Levels unlock rewards (avatar customization, badges, features).

• **Token Economy**: In-game currency earned via daily logins, achievements, tournaments, and special events. Spent on health packs, avatar items, premium court bookings, and challenge entries. Premium currency (Rally Points) can be purchased with real money.

• **Avatar & Customization**: Personalized avatars with customizable features (appearance, tennis style, equipment, signature shot animation). Unlocked through level progression, achievements, token purchases, and tournament victories.

• **Achievement System**: Structured goals across performance, activity, and social categories. Multi-tiered achievements with rewards (XP, tokens, exclusive items). Shared with community.

• **Activity Logging**: Comprehensive tracking of on-court and off-court activities (matches, training, lessons, social interactions). Powers HP/XP systems and provides data for insights.

## 3. Coach Gamification System

• **Coach Reputation Points (CRP)**: Earned through positive player feedback, successful player progression, and community contributions. Influences coach visibility and booking rates.

• **Coach Experience Points (CXP) & Leveling**: Earned by coaching sessions, player achievements, and content creation. Unlocks advanced coaching tools, higher commission rates, and exclusive certifications.

• **Coach Tokens (CTK)**: Earned through successful coaching, premium content sales, and platform engagement. Spent on marketing tools, professional development resources, and premium analytics.

• **Coach Avatar & Customization**: Professional avatars with customizable branding elements, virtual coaching gear, and badges reflecting expertise and achievements.

• **Coach Achievements**: Recognition for coaching milestones (e.g., number of players coached, total player XP gained, successful challenge completions).

• **Coach Leaderboards**: Ranks coaches based on CRP, CXP, and player success metrics, promoting healthy competition and visibility.

## 4. Coach-Player Ecosystem & Integration

• **Seamless Interaction**: Coaches can assign training plans, challenges, and lessons to players. Players can request coaching, report progress, and provide feedback.

• **Shared Progress**: Player achievements and progress contribute to coach CXP and CRP. Coach guidance directly impacts player HP/XP.

• **Communication Hub**: Integrated messaging and scheduling tools facilitate direct communication and lesson booking.

• **Mutual Benefits**: Players gain structured guidance and motivation; coaches gain reputation, income, and tools to manage their clientele.

## 5. Backend Architecture

• **Modular Design**: Microservices-based architecture for scalability and maintainability.

• **Data Models**: Dedicated data models for players, coaches, gamification elements (HP, XP, Tokens, CRP, CXP), activities, and interactions.

• **API Endpoints**: RESTful APIs for all frontend-backend communication, ensuring secure and efficient data exchange.

• **Real-time Updates**: WebSockets for real-time updates on HP, XP, messages, and activity feeds.

## 6. Responsive Design & UI/UX

• **Intuitive Navigation**: Clear and consistent navigation for both player and coach roles.

• **Visual Feedback**: Gamified elements (HP bars, XP progress, token counts) are visually prominent and provide immediate feedback.

• **Personalized Dashboards**: Tailored dashboards for players (progress, challenges) and coaches (client management, analytics).

## 7. Implementation Roadmap & Conclusion

• **Phased Approach**: Development will follow a phased roadmap, prioritizing core gamification features and essential coach-player interactions.

• **Continuous Iteration**: Agile development methodology with regular releases and feedback integration.

• **Scalability**: Architecture designed to support future growth and feature expansion.
